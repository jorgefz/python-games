********** GALACTICA **********
	
=== Tutorial (updated as game is developed)

0) Introduction

This is a text-based terminal-like space exploration game.
You are the only person in a small but compact ship called 'Galactica'.

You are free to roam the universe, but take good care of your ship too!
Don't run out of fuel or oxygen, and avoid damaging the hull or the reactor!

Anyhow, let's get started.

To begin, just type the command 'help' and press enter.
It should show a list of useful commands. Try the command 'status'.
It will display the current status of the ship.
